# Thane5's Canon Picture Styles
A collection of selfmade picture styles for Canon cameras. The "Neutral" series are newer and have more accurate colors. The "Faithful" series is older and i don't recommend using them.


### Neutral Juicy
- Based on "Neutral", but better colors, better contrast. 

### Neutral Extra Juicy
- Neutral Juicy, but pushed further

### Neutral Juicy Soft
- Neutral Juicy but with less contrast, for when you are dealing with strong lighting situations and want to retain a bit more dynamic range



### Faithful Punchy
- A general purpose style based on "Faithful", but colours are pushed to look more like "Standard", plus some more contrast.

### Faithful Punchy Light
- Faithful Punchy, but no change to contrast. A good universal replacement for "Faithful".

### Faithful Punchy Filmic
- Faithful Punchy, but with -2 contrast, for more gentle shadows and highlights.
